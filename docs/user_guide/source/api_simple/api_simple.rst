Simple Language Bindings APIs
#############################

The current simple APIs are designed for simple and direct tasks in which performance is not a critical aspect. Unlike the :ref:`Full Language Bindings APIs` the simple APIs only require a single object/handler. Thus offering a nearly-flat learning curve for first-time users.

Typical scenarios for using the simple APIs are:

* Reading a file to perform data analysis with libraries (matplotlib, scipy, etc.)
* Interactive: few calls make interactive usage easier. 
* Saving data to files is small or personal projects
* Online frameworks: *e.g.* Jupyter notebooks

The designed functionality syntax is closely related to the native language IO bindings for formatted text IO *e.g.* C++ ``fstream``, C ``FILE*``, Fortran and Python file IO.
The main function calls are: ``open`` (or constructor in C++), ``write``, ``read`` and ``close`` (or destructor in C++).
In addition, ADIOS2 borrows the corresponding language native syntax for advancing lines to advance the step in write mode, and for a "step-by-step" streaming basis in read mode.
See each language section in this chapter for a write/read example.

.. warning::

   The simplified APIs are not meant to be used inside applications in which the end user has no access to the IO layer and/or when performance and full functionality are critical, *e.g.* running on a HPC cluster at scale. Use the :ref:`Full Language Bindings APIs` instead

.. note::

   The simpified APIs are based on language native file IO interface. Hence ``write`` and ``read`` calls are always synchronized and variables data memory is ready to use immediatley after these calls.


Currently ADIOS2 support bindings for the following languages and their minimum standards:

+----------+----------+-------------------------+-----------------+
| Language | Standard | Interface               | Based on        |
+----------+----------+-------------------------+-----------------+
| C++      | 11/newer | ``#include adios2.h``   | ``fstream``     |
+----------+----------+-------------------------+-----------------+
| C        | 99       | ``#include adios2_c.h`` | stdio ``FILE*`` |
+----------+----------+-------------------------+-----------------+
| Fortran  | 90       | ``use adios2``          | Fortran/stdio   |
+----------+----------+-------------------------+-----------------+
| Python   | 2.7/3    | ``import adios2``       | Python IO       |
+----------+----------+-------------------------+-----------------+
| Matlab   |          |                         |                 |
