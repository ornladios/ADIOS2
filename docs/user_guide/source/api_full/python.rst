.. note::

   Product Application Developers targeting finer-level control for their IO tasks for optimization should use the current full APIs. If you want to use ADIOS2 in simple use cases (*e.g.* reading a file for analysis, interactive Python, or saving some data for a small project) please refer to the :ref:`High-Level Language Bindings APIs` for a flat learning curve.

The full Python APIs follow very closely the full C++11 API interface.
Work in progress.
