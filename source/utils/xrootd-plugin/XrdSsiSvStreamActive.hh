// streaming data out of a data source that can't give you the full response
// or one whose response requires some calculation. Active streams supply

// They are good to use when the data source manages the data buffers.

// The constructor we have accepts two arguments for testing puposes.

// fd  - the file descriptor that will supply the data (we use a file).

// rsz - tells us how much data the stream is actually to return which can be
//       smaller or greater than the passed desired size. This will fully test
//       the server-side stream handling logic and is immaterial to the example.
//       If it is negative an error is returned after the first abs(rsz) amount
//       is returned to test that code path as well.
