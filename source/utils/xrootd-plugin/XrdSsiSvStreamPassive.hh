// streaming data out of a data source that can't give you the full response
// or one whose response requires some calculation. Passive streams are
// supplied a data buffer to fill with response data). They are very simple.
// Since this is for server-side use we need not define an async method as
// async streams are never used server-side.

// fd  - the file descriptor that will supply the data (we use a file).

// rsz - tells us how much data the stream is actually to return which can be
//       smaller or greater than the passed desired size. This will fully test
//       the server-side stream handling logic and is immaterial to the example.
//       If it is negative an error is returned after the first abs(rsz) amount
//       is returned to test that code path as well.
