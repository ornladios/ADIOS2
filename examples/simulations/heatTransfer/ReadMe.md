### ADIOS2 heatTransfer example

This example solves a 2D Poisson equation for temperature in homogeneous media
using finite differences. This examples shows a straight-forward way to hook
an application to the ADIOS2 library for its IO.

1. write: illustrates the Write API as well as has implementations of other IO libraries
   * adios 2
   * hdf5 sequential, separate file per process per step
   * phdf5 parallel, steps appended to the same one file

2. read: illustrates the Read API that allows running the reader either as
   * post-mortem to read all output steps
   * in situ to read step by step as the writer outputs them (need to run with a suitable engine)

3. readFileOnly: illustrates reading all output steps at once (a single read
   statement) into a single contiguous memory block. This approach only works
   for post-mortem processing.

4. inline: illustrates the inline engine that allows the reader to read the
   data as it is being written.

#### Example

##### 1. Build the example
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<adios2-install-dir> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install ..
$ make -j 8
$ cd ..

##### 1. Produce an output

```
Writer usage:  heatTransfer  config output  N  M   nx  ny   steps iterations
  config: XML config file to use
  output: name of output data file/stream
  N:      number of processes in X dimension
  M:      number of processes in Y dimension
  nx:     local array size in X dimension per processor
  ny:     local array size in Y dimension per processor
  steps:  the total number of steps to output
  iterations: one step consist of this many iterations
```

The ADIOS2 executable needs an XML config file to select the ADIOS Engine and associated parameters that are to be used for the output. The *.xml config files examples/simulations/heatTransfer/ directory are provided as example configurations. 

The adios1, ph5 and hdf5 versions of the example do not use XML config files, so just type "none" for the config
argument.

```
$ mpirun -np 12 ./build/write/adios2_simulations_heatTransferWrite heat_file.xml heat.bp 4 3 5 10 10 10
$ mpirun -np 12 ./build/write/adios2_simulations_heatTransferWrite heat_hdf5.xml heat.h5 4 3 5 10 10 10
```

##### 2. Read the output step-by-step and print data into text files (data.<rank> per reader process)

```
Reader Usage: heatRead  config  input  output N  M
  config:  XML config file to use
  input:   name of input data file/stream
  output:  name of output data file/stream
  N:       number of processes in X dimension
  M:       number of processes in Y dimension
```

```
$ mpirun -np 2 ./build/read/adios2_simulations_heatTransferRead  heat_file.xml heat.bp read.bp 2 1
```

##### Notes:

1. Engines for file-based output and post-mortem reading: i
   * BPFileWriter/BPFileReader
   * HDF5Writer/HDF5Reader

2. Engines for in situ execution
   * DataManWriter/DataManReader (Must run writer and reader with the same number of processes and same decomposition)
