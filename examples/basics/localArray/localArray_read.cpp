 * Read local arrays from multiple processors using BlocksInfo and
 * block-selection.
 *
 * If one cannot or does not want to organize arrays present on each process
 * as one global array, still one can write them out with the same name.
 * Reading, however, needs to be handled differently: each process' array has
 * to be read separately, using Block selections. The size of each process
 * block should be discovered by the reading application by inquiring per-block
 * size information of the variable, and allocate memory for reading
 * accordingly.
 *
 * In this example we read v0, v1, v2 and v3, in 5 output steps
 * from localArray_write, where
 * v0 has the same size on every process at every step
 * v1 has different size on each process but fixed over time
 * v2 has different size on each process and that is changing over time
 * v3 is like v2 but also the number of processes writing it changes over time
 *
 * The reading method shown here works for global arrays just as well, since
 * global arrays are nothing but local arrays with extra metadata to present
 * them as global arrays. The only difference is that the block.Start array
 * tells the offset of the block in the global space, while it's empty in
 * this example.
