## Reporting a Vulnerability

The ADIOS2 team and community take security bugs in ADIOS2 seriously.
We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/ornladios/ADIOS2/security/advisories/new) tab.

The ADIOS2 team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.


## Escalation

If you do not receive an acknowledgement of your report within 6 business days,
or if you cannot find a private security contact for the project, you may escalate to the ADIOS2 mailing list at `adios-ecp@kitware.com`.

If the project acknowledges your report but does not provide any further response or engagement within 14 days, escalation is also appropriate.
