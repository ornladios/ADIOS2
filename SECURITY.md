# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported           |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| 2.10.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 2.10.x | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

## Escalation

If you do not receive an acknowledgement of your report within 6 business days,
or if you cannot find a private security contact for the project, you may escalate to the ADIOS2 mailing list at `https://groups.google.com/a/kitware.com/g/adios-ecp`.

If the project acknowledges your report but does not provide any further response or engagement within 14 days, escalation is also appropriate.
