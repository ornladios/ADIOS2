# ADIOS 2 : The Adaptable Input Output System version 2
This is ADIOS 2 : The Adaptable Input/Output (I/O) System, ADIOS 2 is developed as part of the United States Department of Energy's Exascale Computing Program.

ADIOS 2 is a framework designed for scientific data I/O to publish and subscribe (put/get) data when and where required. 

ADIOS 2 transports data as groups of self-describing variables and attributes across different media types (such as files, wide-area-networks, and remote direct memory access) using a common application programming interface for all transport modes. ADIOS 2 can be used on supercomputers, commercial clouds, and personal computers.

ADIOS 2 focuses on:

1. **Performance** I/O scalability in high performance computing (HPC) applications.
2. **Adaptability** unified interfaces to allow for several modes of transport (files, memory-to-memory)  
3. **Ease of Use** two-level application programming interface (APIs)
    * Full APIs for HPC applications: C++11, Fortran 90, C 99, Python 2 and 3 
    * Simplified High-Level APIs for data analysis: Python 2 and 3, C++11, Matlab  
    
In addition, ADIOS 2 APIs are based on:

* **MPI** ADIOS 2 is MPI-based, it can be used in non-MPI serial code.

* **Data Groups** ADIOS 2 favors a deferred/prefetch/grouped variables transport mode by default to maximize data-per-request ratios. Sync mode, one variable at a time, is treated as the special case.

* **Data Steps** ADIOS 2 follow the actual production/consumption of data using an “steps” abstraction removing the need to manage extra indexing information.

* **Data Engines** ADIOS 2 Engine abstraction allows for reusing the APIs for different transport modes removing the need for drastic code changes.
